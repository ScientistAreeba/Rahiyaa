# Rahiya Project

Rahiya is a database-driven project built using the MERN stack, designed to provide a responsive and reliable ride-hailing experience. Originally developed as a database course project, it includes robust features for both users and admins, utilizing SQL and MongoDB for data management and storage. With role-based access control and a dynamic UI, Rahiya offers an intuitive interface, showcasing our practical understanding of databases within a full-stack application.

## About the Project
Rahiya is a web-based ride-hailing application that we developed as a team for our database course project. While focused on database principles, it evolved into a full-stack web application, using both SQL and MongoDB to manage and track ride-related data. With separate user and admin interfaces, Rahiya delivers a seamless experience for all users and showcases our journey from database students to (almost) full-stack developers.
